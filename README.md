# Ex-06-Feature-Transformation
# AIM:
To read the given data and perform Feature Transformation process and save the data to a file.

# Explanation:
Feature transformation is a mathematical transformation in which we apply a mathematical formula to a particular column (feature) and transform the values, which are useful for our further analysis. It is a technique by which we can boost our model performance.

# ALGORITHM:

STEP 1
Read the given Data

STEP 2
Clean the Data Set using Data Cleaning Process

STEP 3
Apply Feature Transformation techniques to all the feature of the data set

STEP 4
Save the data to the file

# PROGRAM:
```
import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

#Read the data from CSV file

data = pd.read_csv("Data_to_Transform.csv")

#Perform logarithm transformation on "Moderate Positive Skew" column

data['Moderate Positive Skew Log'] = np.log(data['Moderate Positive Skew'])

#Perform logarithm transformation on "Highly Positive Skew" column

data['Highly Positive Skew Log'] = np.log(data['Highly Positive Skew'])

#Perform logarithm transformation on "Moderate Negative Skew" column

data['Moderate Negative Skew Log'] = np.log(data['Moderate Negative Skew'])

#Perform logarithm transformation on "Highly Negative Skew" column

data['Highly Negative Skew Log'] = np.log(data['Highly Negative Skew'])

#Save the transformed data to a new CSV file

data.to_csv("Data_Transformed.csv", index=False)

#Print the transformed data

print(data)
```
# OUTPUT:

# RESULT:
Thus, to read the given data and perform Feature Generation process and save the data to a file has been successfully performed.
